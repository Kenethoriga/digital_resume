           <h2>Is Flask Good For Website?</h2>
           <p>Getting into web development can be accomplished with Flask. Django is not as popular as many flask-based websites, but they do gain heavy traffic. Flask allows you to add more functionality and complexity to simple applications.</p>            
           <h2>Is Making A Portfolio Website Worth It?</h2>
           
           <p>I agree with you. Your portfolio shows how you are interested in, thinking about, and working. It is important that you have a portfolio that reflects who you are. It is possible to display every piece of work you have ever done, whether it be a development or an idea you are still working on. </p>
